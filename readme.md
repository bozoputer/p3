# Developer's Best Friend



#Project 2 - Developer's Best Friend (Laravel Basics)


##Description
Developer's Best Friend (DBF) is a suite of tools to help software developers during the application development process. 

Currently, the suite is comprised of a placeholder text (Ã  la Lorem Ipsum) generator and a random profile generator, but more tools will be added in the future.

Similar tools can be found in myriad other places on the Internet, but ours our way cooler :)

DBF was created for the Harvard Extension School course, Dynamic Web Applications (CSCI E-15). 

###Project goal:
